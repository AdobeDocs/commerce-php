# Magento_Company module

The Magento_Company module allows a merchant to create a company account and assign multiple members of the company to the account.

The module also implements roles and permissions for the company members. The company admin builds a hierarchical company structure (which consists of teams and users) in the storefront and assigns roles and permissions to the company members. This hierarchy allows the company admin to control user activity within the account. This hierarchy as well as roles and permissions are currently available in the storefront only. A merchant can only view the list of company members in Admin.
A merchant can view and manage company profiles in Admin. A company's status controls what kind of access the company members have to the website. An admin user can also configure company-level emails and allow or disallow a company registration from the storefront. Also, this module adds a 'customer type' attribute to the customer in Admin: individual user, company member or company admin.
