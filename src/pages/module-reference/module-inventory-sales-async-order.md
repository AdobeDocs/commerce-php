# InventorySalesAsyncOrder module

The `InventorySalesAsyncOrder` module integrates Inventory Sales logic with Async Order module.
It gives ability to use "Use deferred Stock update" config option with async order.

## Usage

|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | 1                         | Reservation is created when async order is processed by consumer.                                                   |
