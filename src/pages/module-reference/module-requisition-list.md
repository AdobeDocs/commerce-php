# Magento_RequisitionList

The Magento_RequisitionList module allows a customer to create multiple lists of frequently-purchased items and use those lists for order placement. This feature is available for both logged-in users and guests.

RequisitionList functionality is similiar to wish lists, but it has the following differences:

* A requisition list is not purged after sending items to the shopping cart. It can be used to place multiple orders.

* The UI for requisition lists has been modified to a compact view in order to display large number of items.

The merchant can configure maximum number of requisition lists per customer.

## Installation details
