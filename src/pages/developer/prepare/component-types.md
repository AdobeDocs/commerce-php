Each component type has a different [directory structure][directory-structure] and different contents for [`composer.json`][composer].

{% include php-dev/composer-types.md %}

[directory-structure]: ../build/component-file-structure.md
[composer]: ../build/composer-integration.md
[component-file-structure]: ../prepare/component-file-structure.md
