Before you start building Magento modules, we suggest you use the following checklist:

*  [Install Magento and any required dependencies](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/bk-install-guide.html)
*  [Set Magento for developer mode](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-mode.html#change-to-developer-mode)
*  Decide which type of component you're creating and [how to set it up](../build/composer-integration.md) in `composer.json`.
*  [Understand the component file structure](../prepare/component-file-structure.md)
