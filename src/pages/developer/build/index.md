Building your component involves laying out the file structure, creating the necessary configuration files, building out any needed [API](https://glossary.magento.com/api) interfaces and services, and adding any [frontend](https://glossary.magento.com/frontend) parts needed for your component.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin creating your new component, make sure that you have a working installation of Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source.

Also, we recommend that you disable caching while setting up the component file structure and adding configuration files.

The following details the component building process:

*  [Create composer.json](composer-integration.md)
*  [Define your configuration files](required-configuration-files.md)
*  [Create your component file structure](component-file-structure.md)
*  [Register your component](component-registration.md)
*  [URN schema validation](schema-validation.md)
*  [Name your component](component-name.md)
*  [Component load order](component-load-order.md)
*  [Enable your component](component-management.md)
