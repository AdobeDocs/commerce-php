# Add CLI commands

Your module can optionally use the Symfony-based [command-line interface (CLI)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/configuration-guide/cli/config-cli.html) to provide commands for users to interact with. To use the CLI, see the following topics:

*  [Command naming guidelines](naming-guidelines.md)
*  [Create a new command](custom.md)
*  [List of Magento CLI commands](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/tools/cli-reference/commerce-on-premises)
