# Roadmap for developing and packaging components

To develop your component, use the following steps:

1. Learn about [using Composer with your component](../build/composer-integration.md).
1. [Build your component](../build/index.md)
1. [Package a component](../package/component.md)
1. [Validate your component](../validate/test-component.md)
1. Upload the components to the Commerce Marketplace.

   See the [Commerce Marketplace User Guide](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/marketplace/guides/sellers/) for details.
