# Prepare

Before you start building components, we suggest you use the following checklist:

*  [Install Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/installation-guide/overview)
*  [Set the application to developer mode](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/configuration-guide/cli/set-mode#change-to-developer-mode)
*  Decide which type of component you're creating and [how to set it up](../build/composer-integration.md) in `composer.json`.
*  [Understand the component file structure](../prepare/component-file-structure.md)
