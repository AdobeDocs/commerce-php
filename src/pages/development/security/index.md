# Security

This section contains information that Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source developers can use to improve the security of the components that they build.

Topics in this section include:

-  [**Authorization**](authorization.md)—Control access to pages using different authorization strategies.
-  [**Brute force attacks**](brute-force.md)—Identify and protect component functionality vulnerable to brute force attacks.
-  [**Content security policies**](content-security-policies.md)—Mitigate against cross-site scripting and related attacks with content security policies.
-  [**Cross-site request forgery**](cross-site-request-forgery.md)—Leverage built-in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection when developing components.
-  [**Cross-site scripting**](cross-site-scripting.md)—Implement cross-site-scripting (XSS) prevention strategies when developing components.
-  [**Denial of service (DoS) attacks**](denial-of-service-attacks.md)—Identify and protect component functionality vulnerable to denial of service attacks.
-  [**File uploads**](file-uploads.md)—Use out-of-the-box abstraction to safely work with user-uploaded files.
-  [**Mass assignment**](mass-assignment.md)—Prevent components from allowing bad actors to override user-editable properties with arbitrary values in HTTP requests.
-  [**Non-secure functions**](non-secure-functions.md)—Avoid using PHP functions in components that are known to be vulnerable and exploitable.
-  [**Sensitive information**](sensitive-information.md)—Prevent components from exposing sensitive information, like customer passwords, addresses, and dates of birth
-  [**Server-side request forgery**](server-side-request-forgery.md)—Follow these strategies to prevent server-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in components.
-  [**Subresource integrity**](subresource-integrity.md)— Security feature that enables browsers to verify the resources that they fetch.
