# Customize checkout

Checkout is implemented using the [UI components](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/frontend-core/ui-components/).
Out of the box, the checkout consists of two steps:

-  Shipping Information
-  Review and Payment Information

The checkout totals and the corresponding side-bar are only displayed after the first step is completed.

The only exception is checkout of virtual and/or downloadable products: if there are only these  types of products in the shopping cart, checkout is automatically transformed to one-step procedure, because shipping information is not required.

For the sake of compatibility, upgradability, and easy maintenance, do not edit the default application code. Add your customizations in a custom module.
