# Architectural diagram

Depending upon your role and purpose for learning more about Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source, there are several different ways to view the architecture. For example, a developer who wants to create new modules or perhaps customize an existing module will want to understand the architecture of a module itself, and how it fits into the larger view, with the Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source framework (Commerce framework) and other components. However, a merchant who wants to quickly build an online storefront wants to view the collection of components from a higher level, and understand the components that impact the look, feel, and user interaction components.

The following diagram illustrates the components and shows the "layers" or tiers in the Commerce framework.
