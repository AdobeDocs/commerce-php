# Technical vision

The Magento technical vision is a collection of documents that describe the desired state of the Magento platform.

Each individual technical vision document relates to a set of modules that are logically grouped together. Individual documents typically describe a component's place in the system, its architecture, extension scenarios and a list of invariants that must be preserved at all times during component refactoring or extension to ensure consistency.

See the [Magento Coding Standards](../coding-standards.md) for information about writing clean, readable code.
